# EDA-ChiTrafficCams

### Introduction
In this project, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Speed Camera Violations dataset from the Chicago Data Portal. 

### Data
The City of Chicago has installed automatic speed cameras for Child Safety Zones. This notebook explores the dataset "Speed Camera Violations" which reflects the daily volume of violations that have occurred in Children's Safety Zones for each camera. The data reflects violations that occurred from July 1, 2014 until present, minus the most recent 14 days (updated daily). The data I used contains the collection period from July 1, 2014 to December 23, 2018. The size of the dataset used for this project is 23.5 MB.

### Questions to Explore
* 1 What is the average number of citations issued per camera, per day?
* 2 On which day of the week are the most citations issued?
* 3 Has the number of active cameras increased or decreased over the collection period?
* 4 Any interesting patterns or specific outliers in the data?

### Installation and Usage
